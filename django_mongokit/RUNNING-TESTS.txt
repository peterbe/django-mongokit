To run the tests you need to have Django in the Python path and you
need to have a settings file and this needs to be export as per example:

        export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=test_settings
	
To be able to run the tests you need to have mongoDB running. Then you
can simply run the tests by running:

        python tests.py
	
To run with coverage and reporting simple set the
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE and then run it like this:

        coverage run tests.py
	coverage report __init__.py document.py mongodb/__init__.py shortcut.py mongodb/base.py
	coverage html
	firefox htmlcov/index.html

Alternatively you can just run the script:

        ./test_with_coverage.sh
